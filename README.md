I am a huge fan of MMA, and particularly enjoy watching UFC, as they have the top talent and most intriguing matchups in my opinion. I recently started a master's program in Business Analytics and wanted to apply my stats and ML knowledge to something I already enjoy doing, that being predicting MMA matchups. 

This is a predictive model that was trained on historical UFC fight data. Current features include strikes landed per minute, strikes absorbed per minute, reach difference and age difference between pairs of fighters. The output ranges from 0 to 1, indicating if the 'red' fighter will win or not. 1 stands for 'win' and 0 stands for 'lose'. 

This project is fairly new, and I will do my best to make changes as I see fit. The features are fairly limited, and I wonder if there might be some data leakage. Predictive accuracy sits at 62% from internally validated test data, however I will keep track of this accuracy as more fights play out.
